      <h2>We run Rivers to relax</h2>
      <p><span>We believe that there is nothing like a river</span>  <span>trip for relaxing. That is why we subscribe to</span> <span>the dry oar philosophy of boating. Keeping your</span> <span>oars dry for us means taking time to look around and</span> <span>notice the beauty that surrounds the rivers we love.</span></p>

      <h2>We run Whitewater for the Rush!</h2>
		  <p class='para'><span>That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites </span><span> in all things after all. We believe that that tenseness that </span><span>comes when you are looking down the tongue of a big</span><span> string of waves makes you appreciate the calm beautiful</span><span>  water that always follows even more.</span></p></section>
      
      <section><h2>Come join us now</h2>
