            <section class='two'>
            <h3>Breathing Pointers</h3>
                <ul class='safe'>
                    <li>1. Breathe calmly and slowly for 2 minutes – No deeper or faster than you would normally</li>
                    <li>2. Take a deep breath in, then exhale everything, then take a really deep breath in as deep as you can manage.</li>
                    <li>3. As you hold your breath, relax and think of other things.</li>
                    <li>4. After a dive you are breathing heavily and your heart rate is up. You need to do 2 things: re-oxygenate your body and rest/recover.</li>
                    <li>5. Focus on deeper and deeper breaths and this will help slow your breathing down.</li>
                    <li>6. Repeat each step and remember that rest in-between dives are crucial.</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>Equipment and Shooting Pointers</h3>
                <ul class='safe'>
                    <li>1. Understand the principles of buoyancy: When you are underwater it is not gravity that keeps you moving but buoyancy.Therefore, never forget to wear a weight belt. </li>
                    <li>2. Carry a knife along with you underwater: You will be amazed at the amount of times you will have to disentangle yourself or your partner.</li>
                    <li>3. Always use a low volume mask:  If you are using the right kind of mask it will enable you to stay under water longer without putting a lot of stress on your body.</li>
                    <li>4. Make certain that you keep the spear gun in great shape:The spear gun needs regular maintenance such as drying it after each use, polishing it, storing it in a cool place away from moisture.</li>
                    <li>5. Only use your spear or speargun underwater and keep in mind how far the shot will travel and what you are aiming at.</li>
                    <li>6. Be careful about the recoil of the gun which could result in harm such as broken teeth and noses.</li>
                    <li>7. When shooting with a speargun draw an imaginary line from the but end of your gun to about 15ft from the muzzle and lead the fish with that imaginary line and then squeeze the trigger.</li>
                    <li>8. When using a pole spear to generate a shot at a fish, grab the rubber tube and pull down towards the spear head. When you let go, the spear ‘shoots’ or jumps forward because of the rubber tube contracting.(If the pole starts bending on you, try twisting the spear once or twice as you pull the rubber tube causing the rubber to wrap around the spear</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>Checking Your Surroundings </h3>
                <ul class='safe'>
                    <li>1. Before jumping in always plan 2-3 designated areas to get out in case tide rises, current picks up, or emergency occurs.</li>
                    <li>2. Pick one direction to dive towards so you can plan your exit areas</li>
                    <li>3. Check to see if there are large wave before jumping in.(If the waves are big the water will almost always be murky or cloudy which makes vision underwater very difficult</li>
                    <li>4. Always check to see if there are natural occurances such as fish being chased by large preditors such as sharks or dolphins to prevent danger. </li>
                    <li>5. Always have a second pair of eyes, meaning Never Dive Alone!!!</li>
