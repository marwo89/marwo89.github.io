                <h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>
                <!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the visitor considerations document-->
                <p>1. What are their demographics? Age, Income, Education, Geographic Location.<br><br> This website is one that would be more appealing to persons of 14 and over, mainly those that like sports. It doesn’t matter the education or income, just internet access is necessary to be able to visit this site mobily.</p>

                <p>2. How did the site meet the needs of the visitor (be specific in terms of "Less is More)?<br><br>The site give two things that are most important to visitors, scores and game/match schedules with date and times. This makes life easy and simple for the user and this mobile site shows how "less" is much more appealing.</p>

                <p> 3. Describe how the content was organized to facilitate it being found.<br><br> Menu bar at top to select desired sport, to news of the day on front of page, and  sport matchup of the day including time viewing on espn's channel. Also scores tab for quick review.</p>

                <p> 4. What did the site to make the mobile experience enjoyable (or at least not painful)?<br><br> Simple and easy to find what I was looking for, scores of all games at the end of the day. I didn't have to sort through tons of material. I pressed two tabs and got what I was looking for.</p>

                <p>5. Did the site seem to facilitate people in a mobile environment (Think about the descriptions in the Visitor Considerations reading)? If "Yes", how?<br><br> Yes, this site has adapted well to mobile access especially since users are now able to watch games from phones rather than needing a laptop or cable t.v. This allows full access and less material distraction from the original site.

                <h2>Contrasting Site</h2>
                <p>1.	What was the worst site you came across during the 24 hour mobile browsing experience (list it's name and url)?<br><br>

                    rue21 at <a href="http://www.rue21.com/store/">http://www.rue21.com/store/</a> </p>

                <p> 2.	How did your best site differ from the worst in knowing who their target audience was?<br><br>

                    Viewers are simpler to please that shoppers. Espn didn't need much comparing or searching to find what I needed, but rue21 took a lot of back and forth scrolling just to compare a few items. </p>

                <p>3.	How did your best site differ from the worst in meeting the needs of their audience?<br><br>

                    Simpler page works better to view material on espn that view clothing at rue21. </p>

                <p> 4.	How did your best site differ from the worst in organizing content to facilitate it being found?<br><br>

                    Organization was fine for both sites. </p>

                <p> 5.	How did your best site differ from the worst in facilitating visitors in a mobile environment?<br><br>

                    Both sites did well in providing needed material to search the site. It is just the ammont that can be seen, but the site doesn't affect that, it is the size of the screen.
